# Emotion Detection with YOLOv5

This project is designed to detect and classify emotions in facial images using the YOLOv5 object detection model. The model is trained to recognize various emotional expressions. The project was presented and published at the **OpenReadings 2023** conference.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to detect and classify facial emotions in real-time using a custom YOLOv5 model. The dataset used for training was managed and pre-processed via the **Roboflow** platform, which allowed for efficient annotation and dataset version control. The model was trained with high accuracy, making it capable of detecting and classifying emotions such as joy, sadness, surprise, anger, etc., from facial expressions in images.

This project was officially published and presented at the **OpenReadings 2023** conference. The full abstract and details can be found in the conference proceedings on **page 198**: [OpenReadings 2023 Abstract](https://openreadings.eu/wp-content/abstracts/abstract-2023.pdf).
